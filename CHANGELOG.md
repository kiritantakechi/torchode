# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased

### Fixed

- `PIDController` (the default controller) no longer produces NaNs when selecting
  the initial step size for a zero-length integration interval. The guard added to
  `IntegralController` in #45 was missing from `PIDController`.

### Changed

- Modernized the project for Python 3.14 and the `uv` toolchain. The minimum
  supported versions are now Python 3.14, PyTorch 2.12 and SymPy 1.14.
- Migrated the tensor shape/dtype annotations from the unmaintained `torchtyping`
  package to [`jaxtyping`](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/jaxtyping).
- Replaced the `flake8`/`black`/`isort` configuration with `ruff` for linting and
  formatting.
- `Status` is now an `IntEnum`, so its members compare equal to the integer status
  codes returned in `Solution.status`.
- Switched the development, test and documentation dependencies to PEP 735
  dependency groups and added a `uv.lock` lock file.
- Reduced the CPU-GPU synchronizations in the solver loop by resolving the
  evaluation indices directly instead of an extra `to_be_evaluated.any()` check.
- De-duplicated the shared adaptive step-size logic onto the
  `AdaptiveStepSizeController` base class, which `IntegralController` and
  `PIDController` now inherit, so the two controllers can no longer drift apart.

### Removed

- Dropped support for the deprecated `torch.jit` / TorchScript compiler. The
  solver is compiled with `torch.compile` instead, which removes the
  `@torch.jit.export` decorators and the `torch.jit.is_scripting()` branches
  throughout the code.

## 1.0.0 - 2024-09-22

After almost a year without any bugs found, we mark this as the first stable release!

## 0.2.0 - 2023-11-10

### Changed

- Removed compatibility with pytorch 1.x

## 0.1.9 - 2023-08-29

### Added

- Allow passing `dt_0` for the forward and backward pass in the backsolve adjoint

## 0.1.8 - 2023-03-25

### Changed

- Allow installation with pytorch 2.0 and recommend `torch.compile` in the readme

## 0.1.7 - 2023-03-24

### Fixed

- Ensure that `t0` and `direction` have compatible dtypes in `addcmul`

## 0.1.6 - 2023-02-15

### Fixed

- Replaced the `Status` enum with integer constants in internal code to avoid JIT
  compilation issues on some PyTorch versions

  and in the selection of the initial step size

## 0.1.3 - 2023-01-16

### Changed
